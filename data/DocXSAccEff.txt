The meaning of the xsec_collected.csv entries are as follows:
 - model: Name of the model (B3mL2, Y3 etc.).
 - mass: Mass of Z'.
 - xsec_total: Total cross section of the sample before acceptance or efficiency as estimated from the simple average of different runs. USE THIS VALUE TO ESTIMATE ACCEPTANCE*EFFICIENCY.
 - xsec_ss: Portion of the total cross section before acceptance or efficiency that corresponds to Z'ss coupling. USE THIS VALUE TO ESTIMATE ACCEPTANCE*EFFICIENCY.
 - xsec_sb: Portion of the total cross section before acceptance or efficiency that corresponds to Z'sb coupling. USE THIS VALUE TO ESTIMATE ACCEPTANCE*EFFICIENCY.
 - xsec_bb: Portion of the total cross section before acceptance or efficiency that corresponds to Z'bb coupling. USE THIS VALUE TO ESTIMATE ACCEPTANCE*EFFICIENCY.
 - Gamma_ss~: Partial width of Z'->ss~ for this sample.
 - Gamma_sb~: Partial width of Z'->sb~ for this sample (note, this is half of sb~ + bs~ when there is no CP violation).
 - Gamma_bb~: Partial width of Z'->bb~ for this sample.
 - Gamma_mumu: Partial width of Z'->mu-mu+ for this sample.
 - Gamma_Zp: Total width of Z' for this sample.
 - xsec_ss_undoModel: Z'ss cross section undoing model specifics (= xsec_ss*Gamma_Zp/[Gamma_ss~*Gamma_mumu]). All Allanach models at the same mass should give the same number up to stat. fluctuations.
 - xsec_sb_undoModel: Z'sb cross section undoing model specifics (= xsec_sb*Gamma_Zp/[Gamma_sb~*Gamma_mumu]). All Allanach models at the same mass should give the same number up to stat. fluctuations.
 - xsec_bb_undoModel: Z'bb cross section undoing model specifics (= xsec_bb*Gamma_Zp/[Gamma_bb~*Gamma_mumu]). All Allanach models at the same mass should give the same number up to stat. fluctuations.
 - xsec_ss_undoModel_final: Average of xsec_ss_undoModel values over different models at the same mass. Duplicated for each model just because this is a csv file.
 - xsec_sb_undoModel_final: Average of xsec_sb_undoModel values over different models at the same mass. Duplicated for each model just because this is a csv file.
 - xsec_bb_undoModel_final: Average of xsec_bb_undoModel values over different models at the same mass. Duplicated for each model just because this is a csv file.
 - xsec_ss_final: Prediction for xsec_ss for this particular model using the xsec_ss_undoModel_final average, and partial and total width values for this model.
 - xsec_sb_final: Prediction for xsec_sb for this particular model using the xsec_sb_undoModel_final average, and partial and total width values for this model.
 - xsec_bb_final: Prediction for xsec_bb for this particular model using the xsec_bb_undoModel_final average, and partial and total width values for this model.
 - xsec_total_final: Prediction for the total cross section for this model (= xsec_ss_final + xsec_sb_final + xsec_bb_final).
 - xsec_ss_unc: Relative stat. uncertainty on xsec_ss_final, necessarily the same across different models.
 - xsec_sb_unc: Relative stat. uncertainty on xsec_sb_final, necessarily the same across different models.
 - xsec_bb_unc: Relative stat. uncertainty on xsec_bb_final, necessarily the same across different models.

In the final cross section parametrization file 'xsec_interpolation_ZPrimeToMuMuSB_bestfit_13TeV_Allanach.root',
TSpline3 objects named 'spline_[model]_xsec_[ss,sb, or bb]' are provided for the different models and couplings.
TGraph objects with the same name except 'spline'->'gr' are also provided to compare splines to the nodes.

In the final acc.*eff. parametrization file 'acceff_interpolation_Run2.root',
TSpline3 objects named 'spline_[model or avg]_acceff_[ss, sb, or bb]_[Nb_eq_1 or Nb_geq_2]_[period]' are provided for the different models, couplings, and categories.
TGraph objects with the same name except 'spline'->'gr' are also provided to compare splines to the nodes.
Splines with name 'spline_avg_errsq_[dn or up]_acceff_[ss, sb, or bb]_[Nb_eq_1 or Nb_geq_2]_[period]' correspond to squared uncertainties of the averaged acc.*eff. splines.
